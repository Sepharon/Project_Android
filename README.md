This application is part of another big project for the course ITIPRJ. It consists on the control of a Drone using an Android device.

The main purpose of this app is to send messages and handle received messages from a Microcontroller, which is responsible of monitoring the Drone by sending PWM signals depending on the user's decision.

This app can monitor the Drone by sending messages via WiFi using UDP protocol, it can also get the current location of the Drone in order to draw a map, with the help from Google Maps, using a marker showing the actual position. 

Moreover, direction, speed and rotation control of the Drone is implemented with Buttons and the level (up or down) of it we have used the accelerometer sensor from the device.
